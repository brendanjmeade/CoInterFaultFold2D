# Some notes on kinematically consistent coseismic faulting and folding in 2D

The geometric relationship between faults in folds have been extensively documented and modeled (e.g., Suppe, 1985).  The question of when do these folds grow has recieved a bit less attention (e.g., Souter and Hager, 1997; Dolan et al., 2003).  Essentially the question is whether hanging wall folds grow during earthquakes (coseismically) or in between earthquakes (interseismically).  Geodetic evidence for either case appears limited.

So if data are lacking it's the perfect time to understand the behavior of idealized fault and fold models and make predictions for the spatial patterns of surface deformation consisent with both co- and inter-seismic fold growth.  The simple models here do this for single dipping thrust fault that ramps down to a flat detachment.  A single fold bisects these two structures.  Following Souter and Hager (1997) we approximate the fold as a dislocation plane exploiting the focal mechanism ambiguity.  This means that deformation associated with material passing through the kink axis is treated elastically.

The essential results are:
